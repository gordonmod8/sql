**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I can speak to ethics in system engineering because of my time designing autonomous railway signalling. My role involved querying guideway data to generate the inputs for a simulator. The outputs of the simulator were more data which was queried and analyzed to report on system performance, safety, and any operability conflicts arising from the designs. Due to the nature of the data, geographic and physical, no privacy or security improvements are really possible, issues for personal data.
<br><br>
But ethics in system engineering did come up in day to day work. Our ethical issues had to do with the method of preparing every decision we reported. To analyze our premises, to verify and validate every step of our analysis, to have multiple eyes on issues and require multiple signatures for approval, there were just a few of our guardrails to prevent an error from slipping into implementation and cause an accident by maldesign. Cutting such vigilance universally positively impacts budget. Reducing safety margins universally positively impacts budget. Every day on the job we felt pressure to perform thorough analysis upholding moral integrity push up against pressure to stay within budget by working faster or longer, reducing scoper, or implementing technology to script away tedious work.

Looking at Boeing a clear unethically low vigilance continues to make the news. Two 737 MAXs crashed in 2018/2019 claiming 348 lives and this year a door was blown off mid flight causing uncontrolled decompression. Ethical guardrails need to be embedded in the very processes of system engineering. I would institute the following at Boeing:
* project timeline removed from KPI
* hazard resolutions added to KPI (esp. rewards proactive measures / analysis)
* documents prepared in pairs with preparer / reviewer
* approval requires 3 signature of 3 independent senior engineers
* 2 watches in the wild are not sufficient to confirm the time, you need 3 to settle a disagreement
* change requests thoroughly document changes, with references and reasons to justify change
* change approval involves written confirmation about where documentation does describe changes implemented and confirmation of what reasoning or evidence provided was compelling to justify the changes
* Structurally impossible for Sr Engineer to click NEXT NEXT NEXT on 50 change requests in an hour
* PEng approvals to be reviewed by principal eng and professional misconduct / discipline followed to the full measure of due process
* Business critical monitoring on the level of detail in the contents of changes and their approvals - low quality change requests lower KPI and high quality lift KPI
